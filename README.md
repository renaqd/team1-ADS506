Applied Time Series Analysis


## Objective
The primary business objective is to develop an automated forecasting system to predict electricity demand for the period from October 2020 through October 2021, using historical data for timely, proactive decision-making. Success will be measured by achieving accurate forecasts, automating daily forecast generation, reducing resource allocation inefficiencies, and decreasing operational costs while maintaining service reliability. The company faces challenges such as manual intervention in forecasting, market volatility, competition, and government restrictions that impact demand patterns, making efficient forecasting and resource planning critical to its success. This project, led by a data science team from ADS506, seeks to develop a robust forecasting model for electricity demand.
